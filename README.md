# Credit-Scorecard-Modelling
Context:
Credit Risk modelling predicts whether a customer or applicant may or may not default on a loan. These models include predictor variables that are categorical or numeric. One of the outputs in the modelling process is a credit scorecard with attributes to allocate scores.

The objectives of this model are as follow:
•	Create models using logistic regression with manual binning & WOE Binning
•	Compare manual coarse binning with automated optimal Weight-of-Evidence (WOE) and Information Value (IV) binning
•	Understand the WOE calculations
•	Create a credit scorecard with most relevant model

Here we have use a public dataset, German Credit Data, with a binary response variable, good or bad risk. We will evaluate and compare the models with typical credit risk model measures, AUC and Kolmogorov-Smirnov test (KS).
